FIRST TIME SET-UP:

Make sure you install npm/node.

In your root directory, run:

```
npm install
```

To install the latest dependencies.

Refer to this Medium post if you need info on the
processes listed in this README:

USAGE:

```
npm run dev
```

This will run the server and build the webpack at the same time. Very useful. Since we are using nodemon, the server restarts automagically whenever changes are made.

NOTE: Do not pay attention to any of the UI rn, it's just placeholder. Just focused on setup for now.
